# properties-of-matter-scripts

This is a collection of Python scripts I've written while constructing material for the PH1011 Properties of Matter course (Univ. of St. Andrews)

Interested students can download and run the scripts to plot some of the functions we will be considering:

`lennard_jones.py` - plots the Lennard-Jones potential (and simulates the motions of particles in 1D)

`random_walk.py` - simple code for generating random-walks in 2D

`solar_sail_acceleration.py` - how fast can a spacecraft move under photon pressure?

`van_der_waals.py` - constructs P-V isotherms for the ideal gas and Van der Waals equations



The scripts have been developed in Python 3.0, and use the modules `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `scipy`.  If you're new to Python, I highly recommend using Anaconda to install Python plus the modules described above.

Once you have Python installed, the scripts are run by simply typing

`> python scriptname.py`
